# Overview

This is my portfolio page. This will contain all of my software engineering projects (mainly web apps).

This web app will be used to showcase all of my previous projects and future projects.

The purpose of creating this portfolio is to combine all of my learnings and create an ultimate website.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I am using Remix for this software.

Remix is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience. People are gonna love using your stuff.

# Netlify Remix Template

Welcome to the Netlify Remix Template project.

To use the template, run

```bash
npx create-remix@latest --template netlify/remix-template
```

This project includes:

- Netlify Functions template for Remix sites
- Netlify Edge Functions template for Remix sites

## Development

There is no need to run `npm install` as this is a template. The Remix CLI will install the dependencies for you. Make changes to files as you see fit. If there are transformations for files for either the Netlify Functions or Netlify Edge Functions template, make the appropriate changes to the `remix.init/index.js` file.

If you're new to Remix stacks and the remix.init concept, see the official [Remix Stacks](https://remix.run/stacks) documentation.

### Testing your changes

Run

```bash
npx create-remix@latest --template ./
```

to test your changes to the template. Follow the steps the Remix CLI prompts you with to create a new project. Ensure to test for both the Netlify Functions template and the Netlify Edge Functions template.
