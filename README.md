# Overview

This is my portfolio page. This will contain all of my software engineering projects (mainly web apps).

This web app will be used to showcase all of my previous projects and future projects.

The purpose of creating this portfolio is to combine all of my learnings and create an ultimate website.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I am using Remix for this software.

Remix is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience. People are gonna love using your stuff.
